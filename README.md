## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Running the App

### Web

```bash
npm run web
```

### Android

```bash
npm run android
```

### iOS (macOS required)

```bash
npm run ios
```

## Game Rules

### Basic Movement

- All pieces move like rooks in chess (horizontally or vertically)
- Pieces cannot jump over other pieces
- Only the King can occupy corner squares (throne is a normal square)

### Capturing

- Pieces are captured by being surrounded on two opposite sides by enemy pieces or corners
- Corners act as hostile squares for capture purposes
- Captured pieces are immediately removed from the board

### Victory Conditions

- **Attackers win** by capturing the King
- **Defenders win** by getting the King to any corner square

### Special Squares

- **Corners**: Only the King can occupy these squares, and they act as hostile squares for captures

## AI Implementation

The AI uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and evaluates positions based on:

- Piece values and positioning
- King's distance to corners
- Control of center squares
- Mobility of pieces
- Capture opportunities

Difficulty levels adjust search depth and evaluation weights to provide varied gameplay experiences.
